        <h1>OREO Cookie Balls</h1>
        <img src="../images/oreo.jpeg">
        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These cookie balls are essentially truffles. 
        You simply crush up Oreos (we like using a food 
        processor but the old Ziploc bag and rolling pin 
        definitely works), mix them up with cream cheese, 
        and then dunk those balls into. Be prepared to eat 
        the entire batch in one sitting—they're dangerous.</p>
